# Gamestate Communications Design

## Purpose

This document defines the high-level design and protocol for gamestate communications for the Pong3D project. It describes the roles, message flows, data models, synchronization strategy, and testing/validation considerations for an architecture where Player 1's local `Pong3D` instance acts as the authoritative game server ("master") and all other players run client-mode `Pong3D` instances. A lightweight relay server forwards WebSocket messages between participants.

This design prioritizes bandwidth efficiency and simplicity by using input-based communication and raw coordinate transmission.

---

## Checklist (requirements extracted)
- The Player 1 instance of `Pong3D` will be the authoritative gamestate (master/server).
- Other players run `Pong3D` in client mode.
- Clients send only input controls (key press/release events) to the master.
- Master runs authoritative physics simulation and sends position-only updates to all clients.
- Master sends raw X,Z coordinates for all game objects (ball and paddles).
- Ultra-simple message format for easy implementation and debugging.
---

## Actors and Roles

- Master (Authoritative Server)
  - The Player 1 local `Pong3D` instance.
  - Maintains the authoritative game state: ball position/velocity/spin, paddle positions, and scores.
  - Receives input commands from clients and applies them to the authoritative physics simulation.
  - Advances the physics simulation and broadcasts position updates to all clients via the relay server.

- Clients
  - Local `Pong3D` instances running in client mode (players 2..N).
  - Send input commands (paddle direction) to the master via relay server.
  - Receive authoritative position updates from master and render ball and other players accordingly.
  - May apply local prediction for their own paddle for immediate responsiveness.

- Relay Server
  - Simple WebSocket relay (stateless or near-stateless) whose primary job is to forward messages between participants.
  - Does not perform game logic or validation (keeps trust model centralized to master). Optionally performs light checks, authentication, or rate limiting.

---

## Network Topology

- Every participant (master + clients) maintains a single persistent WebSocket connection to the Relay Server.
- Simple message routing:
  - **Input Path**: Client -> Relay -> Master (input commands)
  - **State Path**: Master -> Relay -> All Clients (position updates)

This setup preserves a single authoritative replica while providing low-latency paddle updates and keeping the relay server simple.

---

## Message Types

### 1. Client → Master: Input Commands (on key state change only)
```json
{
  "k": 1
}
```
**Fields:**
- `k`: paddle input state (0=none, 1=left/up, 2=right/down)
- **Size**: ~3 bytes per input change
- **Frequency**: Only when keys are pressed/released (10-20 events/second typical)  
- **Purpose**: Send control input changes to master for authoritative physics

### 2. Master → All Clients: Game State (every update)
```json
{
  "b": [2.340, -1.877],
  "pd": [
    [-2.1, 0],
    [2.1, 0]
  ]
}
```
**Fields:**
- `b`: ball position [x, z]  
- `pd`: paddle positions [x, z] for each player
- **Size**: ~12 bytes for 2P, ~20 bytes for 4P
- **Frequency**: 20-60Hz (as fast as needed)
- **Purpose**: Authoritative positions for rendering

### 3. Event Messages (sent only on change)
```json
// Score update
{ "type": "score", "scores": [3, 1], "scorer": 1 }

// Goal event  
{ "type": "goal", "scorer": 1, "victim": 2 }

// Game control
{ "type": "pause" }
{ "type": "resume" }
{ "type": "reset" }
```

### 4. Connection Messages
```json
// Join game
{ "type": "join", "playerId": 2 }
```

---

## Data Model

### Simple Game State Structure
```typescript
interface GameState {
  b: [number, number];    // ball position [x, z]
  pd: [number, number][];  // paddle positions [[x1,z1], [x2,z2], ...] 
}
```

### Simple Input Command Structure  
```typescript
interface InputCommand {
  k: number;       // paddle input (0=none, 1=left/up, 2=right/down)
}
```

### Paddle Input Encoding
```
0 = No movement (no keys pressed)
1 = Move left/up (A key or W key) 
2 = Move right/down (D key or S key)

Examples for 2P mode:
Player 1: A=left(1), D=right(2), none=0
Player 2: Left arrow=left(1), Right arrow=right(2), none=0
```

### Coordinate System
- **Ball**: Moves freely in X,Z plane (Y fixed at GLB height)
- **Paddles**: 
  - 2P mode: Both move on X-axis (Z positions fixed)
  - 3P mode: P1,P2 on X-axis, P3 on Z-axis
  - 4P mode: P1,P2 on X-axis, P3,P4 on Z-axis
- **Raw coordinates**: No mapping - send actual mesh X,Z values

---

## Synchronization Strategy

### 1. Authority Model
- **Master Authority**: Player 1's Pong3D instance runs authoritative physics simulation
- **Input Processing**: Master processes all client inputs and updates game state
- **Position Authority**: Master owns all object positions (ball, all paddles)

### 2. Simple Client Rendering
```typescript
// Client receives game state and renders directly
receiveGameState(state: GameState) {
  // Update ball position
  this.ballMesh.position.set(state.b[0], this.ballY, state.b[1]);
  
  // Update other paddle positions (skip own paddle if using prediction)
  state.pd.forEach((pos, i) => {
    if (i !== this.myPlayerIndex) {
      this.paddles[i].position.set(pos[0], this.paddleY, pos[1]);
    }
  });
}

// Optional: Client prediction for own paddle
processInput(input: number) {
  // Apply to local paddle immediately for responsiveness
  this.updateLocalPaddle(input);
  
  // Send to master
  this.sendInputToMaster(input);
}
```

## Bandwidth Analysis

### Ultra-Simple Message Sizes
- **Game State (2P)**: ~12 bytes per snapshot
  - Ball XZ (8 bytes) + 2 Paddle XZ (8 bytes) = 16 bytes  
- **Game State (4P)**: ~20 bytes per snapshot  
  - Ball XZ (8 bytes) + 4 Paddle XZ (16 bytes) = 24 bytes
- **Input Command**: ~3 bytes per input change
  - Just the paddle input value: { "k": 1 }

### Simple Bandwidth Usage (20Hz game state, input on change)
```
2-Player Game:
- Master→Clients: 12 bytes × 20Hz = 240 bytes/s per client
- Client→Master: 3 bytes × ~15 changes/s = 45 bytes/s per client
- Total per client: ~285 bytes/s = 0.3 KB/s

4-Player Game:  
- Master→Clients: 20 bytes × 20Hz = 400 bytes/s per client
- Client→Master: 3 bytes × ~15 changes/s = 45 bytes/s per client  
- Total per client: ~445 bytes/s = 0.4 KB/s
```

### Comparison with Traditional Approaches
```
Traditional (position + velocity updates):
- 2P: ~1.3 KB/s per client
- 4P: ~2.6 KB/s per client

Our Optimized Approach:
- 2P: ~0.4 KB/s per client (70% reduction)
- 4P: ~0.6 KB/s per client (77% reduction)
```

### Message Formats
- **Development**: JSON with short field names
- **Production**: Consider MessagePack or custom binary for further optimization

---

## Latency and Performance

### Simple Approach
- **No interpolation**: Clients render positions directly as received
- **Optional client prediction**: Local paddle can move immediately, corrected by server updates
- **Accept some stuttering**: Focus on learning core concepts first
- **Iterate later**: Add smoothing/interpolation only if needed after basic version works

---

## Ordering, Reliability, and Consistency

- WebSockets use TCP, so messages are delivered in order per connection and reliably.
- For critical events (goals, resets), master can send immediate event messages in addition to the regular position updates.

---

## Validation and Anti-Cheating

### Simple Input Validation (Master-Side)
```typescript
validateInput(playerId: number, input: InputCommand): boolean {
  // 1. Rate limiting  
  if (this.getInputRate(playerId) > MAX_INPUT_RATE) {
    return false; // Too many inputs per second
  }
  
  // 2. Input value validation
  if (input.k < 0 || input.k > 2) {
    return false; // Invalid input value (must be 0, 1, or 2)
  }
  
  return true;
}

applyValidatedInput(playerId: number, input: InputCommand) {
  // Apply physics with built-in constraints
  // Paddle boundaries and velocity limits enforced automatically
  this.updatePaddle(playerId, input.k);
}
```

### Physics-Based Anti-Cheat
- **Boundary enforcement**: Master clamps paddle positions to valid range
- **Velocity limits**: Master enforces maximum paddle speed  
- **Deterministic physics**: Same input always produces same result
- **Position authority**: Master position always overrides client prediction

### Network-Level Protection
- **Authentication**: Validate player identity at connection time
- **Rate limiting**: Limit message frequency per connection
- **Input sanitization**: Validate message format and ranges

---

## Failover and Edge Cases

- Master disconnects
  - Primary design assumes Player 1 is master. If master disconnects mid-game, define a strategy:
    - Pause game and attempt to reconnect master, or
    - Elect a new master (e.g., next player index) and perform state transfer (requires snapshot handoff), or
    - Force restart of match. 
  - Handoff/election increases complexity; implement only if uninterrupted play across master failures is required.

- Late joins / reconnections
  - Relay/master should support an explicit `JoinRequest` event; master responds with a full `GameStateSnapshot` to bring new client up to date.
  - On reconnection, clients should resynchronize using latest authoritative snapshot before resuming play.

---

## Security and Privacy

- Use secure WebSocket (wss://) in production.
- Authenticate players at connect time; attach an opaque playerId to the socket connection and do not trust client-supplied playerId fields.
- Relay server should not accept messages from clients that are not authenticated or that claim other players' IDs.

---

## Testing Plan

### 1. Unit Testing
```typescript
// Message serialization/deserialization
describe('GameState Serialization', () => {
  test('simple JSON encoding', () => {
    const state = { b: [2.34, -1.87], pd: [[-2.1, 0], [2.1, 0]] };
    expect(JSON.stringify(state).length).toBeLessThan(40);
  });
});

// Input validation  
describe('Input Validation', () => {
  test('rejects invalid input values', () => {
    expect(validateInput(1, { k: 5 })).toBe(false); // Only 0,1,2 allowed
  });
});
```

### 2. Simple Physics Testing
```typescript
// Verify master processes inputs correctly
describe('Input Processing', () => {
  test('paddle moves correctly for input', () => {
    const game = new MasterGame();
    const initialPos = game.getPaddlePosition(1);
    
    game.processInput(1, { k: 1 }); // Move left
    game.updatePhysics();
    
    expect(game.getPaddlePosition(1)).toBeLessThan(initialPos);
  });
});
```

### 3. Network Testing
- **Mock WebSocket**: Test with simulated network conditions
- **Multi-client testing**: Run master + client locally for testing  
- **Basic integration**: Verify input → master → position update flow

### 4. Basic Integration Testing
- **End-to-end gameplay**: Simple 2-player games over local network
- **Message validation**: Verify message formats are correct
- **Connection handling**: Test join/leave, reconnection scenarios

---

## Versioning and Backwards Compatibility

- Include a small `protocolVersion` field in top-level messages so future changes to message shape can be negotiated.
- When changing semantics (e.g., unit changes, different tick rates), support version negotiation or an upgrade window.
